# Reflection for Week One

This first week working with the materials for HIST3814O was nothing short of an experience. To start, I'd like to give you a brief rundown of who I am and why I'm here. I think it will help provide context to some of my further analysis.
I am going into my fourth year of journalism with a combined honours in geography and a minor in history. 
One thing I feel like I have fallen short on in my acedemic experience, is becoming proficient in using technology.
However, each time a course brings up a new digital tool or database, I enjoy learning how to use it.
That is why I am excited to be here. I am excited to expand my skills using digital tools to help me with research and in other areas of academia.

## Introduction to the Digital Tools

Starting right from the basics, I realized that Chrome is the browser I needed to use to use all of the extensions for this course, but also to be more successful in other areas of research. I am slightly ashamed to admit that I always use to use Microsoft Edge. However, I am now aware of the potential of Chrome and will continue to use it exclusively in the future.
Before I could start with any of the digital tools, I played around with my Chrome settings.

Luckily, I found this pretty simple to do!

### Hypothesis

I had never heard of hypothesis before. I found it simple to download and to join our class group. I played around with the tool a bit on different websites and articles and found it very useful to be able to highlight and provide annotations. I like the way that these annotations can be public. I think it gives an excellent advantage to collaboration on academia. 

### Discord

I already had a discord account that I use as a social media platform with my friends. Thus, joining our class group did not give me any difficulty.

### Zotero

Zotero is by far my favourite digital tool I learned about this week. I downloaded both th extension for Chrome and the desktop app. I love how it simplifies saving all reasearch into one spot, and it provides all bibliographical informaiton! I am going to continue to use Zotero in the future for all assignments in this class, other classes, and throughout my future career. I plan on taking some time to explore the desktop app for Zotero further to experiment with creating different folders to save research for different assignments separately.

### Github

Github is where I ran into trouble. I followed the directions on the syllabus for al setup, but when creating my repository for week two I forgot to initialize it.
