# Reflection for Week One

This first week working with the materials for HIST3814O was nothing short of an experience. To start, I'd like to give you a brief rundown of who I am and why I'm here. I think it will help provide context to some of my further analysis.
I am going into my fourth year of journalism with a combined honours in geography and a minor in history. 
One thing I feel like I have fallen short on in my acedemic experience, is becoming proficient in using technology.
However, each time a course brings up a new digital tool or database, I enjoy learning how to use it.
That is why I am excited to be here. I am excited to expand my skills using digital tools to help me with research and in other areas of academia.

## Introduction to the Digital Tools

Starting right from the basics, I realized that Chrome is the browser I needed to use to use all of the extensions for this course, but also to be more successful in other areas of research. I am slightly ashamed to admit that I always use to use Microsoft Edge. However, I am now aware of the potential of Chrome and will continue to use it exclusively in the future.
