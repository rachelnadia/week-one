# Notes for Week One

Learning how to use Chrome
downloading all of the extensions was a little difficult because I usually use Microsoft Edge
goinng to use Chrome for everything now, way easier!

Downloaded Hypothesis
found it very interesting
like how I can annotate things online
pretty simple to do

I like Zotero
again, easy to use
definitely going to use it for assignments in other disciplines for its use for bibliographic info alone

Already had a discord account so joining dscord was not difficult

Github gave me trouble
